# Isolated Sval preview

Use branch `cleanup/sval-naming` with the matching local firmware and Python GUI
branches. Firmware keymap: `sval`. Keybard accepts the new `sval` feature definition
and the older definition. It also accepts the Python GUI's `sval_protocol` backups.
Legacy backup conversion improvements remain separate work.

## Local testing

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev:sval-preview
```

Open http://localhost:5176/ in a WebHID-capable browser.
Alternatively run `npm run build:sval-preview` then
`npm run preview -- --mode sval-preview --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5176 --strictPort`.

The amber label identifies the preview. Browser settings and saved/imported
layouts use a separate `sval-preview:` namespace. There is no automatic copying
of production browser data; explicitly import a backup if needed. Changes sent
to a connected keyboard still change that real keyboard. Back it up first.

## Publishing later

No repository creation, pushes, Pages changes, or deployments have been performed
as part of preparing this branch.

Use a separate repository, `morganvenable/keybard-sval-preview`, with GitHub Pages
configured to use GitHub Actions. Push this branch there as `cleanup/sval-naming`.
The included Sval preview workflow builds/tests and deploys only to that exact
repository and branch. It is served at:

https://keybard.svalboard.com/

through GitHub Pages with a custom domain: a `keybard` CNAME record on
svalboard.com pointing at `morganvenable.github.io`, and the custom domain set in
the repository's Pages settings (no CNAME file: Actions deployments ignore it).
The app is built for the domain's root (`VITE_BASE_PATH=/`), so the old
https://morganvenable.github.io/keybard-sval-preview/ address redirects to it.
Browser data (settings, saved layouts, WebHID device grants) belongs to an origin,
so the move to the new domain starts each browser fresh there.

Do not run a production Pages deployment to publish a preview. A repository's
Pages deployment replaces that repository's site. In `morganvenable/keybard-ng`,
the preview workflow only produces a downloadable `sval-preview-site` artifact;
it cannot deploy. Both older deployment workflows exclude the preview branch,
and the standard production workflow additionally requires `main`.

A separate project URL on the same github.io host still shares browser storage,
which is why the namespace isolation is required. Production builds retain their
existing `/keybard-ng/` base URL and unprefixed storage keys.

## Acceptance

1. Confirm the preview label and build branch/commit.
2. Connect the matching firmware and verify feature counts, keymaps, combos,
   tap dances, macros, pointing settings, and scan-lab controls as applicable.
3. Save/reload a layout, including one from the renamed Python GUI.
4. Verify the layer library loads under the preview URL.
5. Open production separately and confirm its browser settings/layouts are intact.
6. Power-cycle the test board and verify configuration persistence.

Rollback of the web preview requires no production change. Firmware rollback may
require restoring a backup, depending on which firmware/storage layout is used.

## Production compatibility notice test

The preview deployment also publishes a separately built production guard at
https://keybard.svalboard.com/production-check/ (built with
`VITE_BASE_PATH=/production-check/`, set in the workflow).
Connect renamed Sval firmware there to test the compatibility notice. Its inline
“here” link opens the working preview at the site's root. The test app uses
`keybard-production-check:` browser storage, separate from both other apps.
The workflow pins the guard source commit; update that pin to publish changes.
Production GitHub Pages is not changed by this deployment.
